## What to Bring?
Your Laptop, if possible. Data will be made available in the cloud. We'll be using Colab Notebooks, and everything can be done in the cloud. If you prefer, you can also use your local machine.

## What are we looking for in the participants?
There will be 10 teams of approximately 6-8 participans:
- at least 3 data science
- at least 3 clinical

At least one of the data science participants at each table will have had experience at a prior datathon and/or substantial experience with a PhysioNet dataset and this kind of EHR data analysis. <br>

Everyone attending is interested in EHR data and data science. This is a unique situation where everyone has a pre-selected interest. All the clinical participants have an interest in data science. All the data science participants have an interest in medicine. <br>

At the very least, the **clinical participants** should shape the meaning of the question (especially making sure that the problem is defined in a clinically relevant fashion), lend context to the clinical data, and shape the results. <br>

The **data science particpants** should be ready to learn about the datasets, understand how to effectively extract the relevant data, wrangle data, and analyze the results. <br>
- _Note:_ Some (but not necessarily all) of the clinical participants might want to stretch their data science aspects. Consider supporting their learning here. <br>

Neither side is more important; the interplay of both is critical to effective analysis. We want participants to learn that this is a team science and we really need to engage people with different perspectives and from different areas of expertise to tackle such complex questions.
